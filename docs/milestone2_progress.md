# Milestone 2 Progress
### Team Members: Chris Zou, John Ho, Sho Sho Ho, Jun Chong, Jerry Yang

## Task Assignments

After a team discussion, we've decided on the following breakdown of tasks for Milestone 2. Chris and John will implement the core functionality of our `Expression` class, e.g. initialization and data structures, and ensure a correct forward mode implementation is present. Sho Sho will extend the functionality to support elementary functions such as exponential and trig functions, and implement convenience features such as a `__str__` method. Sho Sho will take the lead on documentation efforts, with assistance from Chris and John. Jun and Jerry will focus on building out our test suite and writing a proposal for future features. They will work with the rest of the team to determine which steps should be taken now in anticipation of these future features. For example, we may decide to support $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^{m} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$ functions now (by making the necessary changes to the data structure used in the `Expression` class, per our previous writeup) to leave more time for implementing future features later. 

## Contributions to Date

All team members contributed to the planning of tasks for Milestone 2 in a group meeting. Chris, John, and Jerry had a discussion on the data structures underlying our `Expression` class based on initial feedback, and decided on a method for handling $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^{m} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$ functions. Sho Sho, Jun, and Jerry worked on writing this report based on the team's decisions. Chris, John, and Sho Sho have together timelined a development schedule for the `Expression` class. Jun and Jerry have started compiling ideas for future features, with input from the rest of the team.
