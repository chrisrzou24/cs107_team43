# Future Features

We plan to make two improvements to our library: optimizations for multivariable expressions, and support for reverse mode automatic differentiation. For the former, we will consider how to best use libraries like `numpy` in computing partial derivatives for $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^{m} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$ functions. This will require changing the data structures that we use for the `real` and `dual` components in our `Expression` class. To implement reverse mode, we will create a class variable that can be set to either `forward` or `reverse` mode. If the variable is set to `forward` mode, all `Expression` objects in the scope will be evaluated with forward mode differentiation. If the variable is set to `reverse` mode, we will use a different data structure (probably an array) to accumlate local gradients during the forward pass, instead of computing the tangent traces. In this case, the `derivative` getter method for our `Expression` object will use the local gradients to compute the partial derivatives. 

The main challenge we foresee in adding these features is implementing reverse mode without adding additional complexity to how the user interacts with the `Expression` class, i.e. the interface should more or less be the same for both forward and reverse mode.
